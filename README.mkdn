# NAME

Test::Memory::Usage - make sure code doesn't unexpectedly eat all your memory

# VERSION

version 0.0.3

# SYNOPSIS

The easiest usage pattern looks like this:

    use Test::Memory::Usage;

    # do some setup; decide that's roughly where you should be with usage
    # levels; draw your lin in the sand
    memory_usage_start;

    # do some things that you want to test as normal
    # ...
    

    # finally, make sure you haven't run away with memory
    memory_usage_ok;
    done_testing;

You can call `memory_usage_start` as often as you like; each call moves the
reference point used for comparison with `memory_usage_ok`:

    # loop over some action and make sure it doesn't grow
    for (1 .. 5) {
        memory_usage_start;

        # bad growing code!
    

        memory_usage_ok(10);
    }

# EXPORTS

Test::Memory::Usage exports the following subs automatically:

- memory_usage_start
- memory_usage_ok
- memory_virtual_ok
- memory_rss_ok
- memory_stack_ok

# METHODS

The module provides the following methods:

## memory_usage_start

This method records the current memory usage and flags it to be used for any
growth tests later in the script.

You can call the method multiple times; each call adds a new state record and
updates makes the most recent state recorded the reference point for any
growth comparisons

This is useful if you want to compare the usage after you've performed a
certain amount of minimum setup before the area(s) of code that you want to
verify memory usage for.

## memory_usage_ok($percentage_limit)

This calls the `memory_virtual_ok()` and `memory_rss_ok()` functions.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory_virtual_ok($percentage_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that virtual memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory_rss_ok($percentage_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that RSS memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory_stack_ok($percentage_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that data/stack memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.
