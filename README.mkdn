# NAME

Test::Memory::Usage - make sure code doesn't unexpectedly eat all your memory

# VERSION

version 0.0.5

# SYNOPSIS

The easiest usage pattern looks like this:

    use Test::Memory::Usage;

    # do some setup; decide that's roughly where you should be with usage
    # levels; draw your lin in the sand
    memory_usage_start;

    # do some things that you want to test as normal
    # ...
    

    # finally, make sure you haven't run away with memory
    memory_usage_ok;
    done_testing;

You can call `memory_usage_start` as often as you like; each call moves the
reference point used for comparison with `memory_usage_ok`:

    # loop over some action and make sure it doesn't grow
    for (1 .. 5) {
        memory_usage_start;

        # bad growing code!
    

        memory_usage_ok(10);
    }

# EXPORTS

Test::Memory::Usage exports the following subs automatically:

- memory\_usage\_start
- memory\_usage\_ok
- memory\_virtual\_ok
- memory\_rss\_ok
- memory\_stack\_ok

# METHODS

The module provides the following methods:

## memory\_usage\_start

This method records the current memory usage and flags it to be used for any
growth tests later in the script.

You can call the method multiple times; each call adds a new state record and
updates makes the most recent state recorded the reference point for any
growth comparisons

This is useful if you want to compare the usage after you've performed a
certain amount of minimum setup before the area(s) of code that you want to
verify memory usage for.

## memory\_usage\_ok($percentage\_limit)

This calls the `memory_virtual_ok()` and `memory_rss_ok()` functions.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory\_virtual\_ok($percentage\_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that virtual memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory\_rss\_ok($percentage\_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that RSS memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

## memory\_stack\_ok($percentage\_limit)

Runs the test to ensure that data/stack memory usage hasn't grown more than
`$percentage_limit`

This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
`memory_usage_ok()` meets their testing needs.

If not provided `$percentage_limit` defaults to '10'.

# AUTHOR'S NOTES

I still have some concerns over the benefit of this module for testing.

While it behaved fairly well locally, the test reports for failures from
[cpantesters.org](http://cpantesters.org/distro/T/Test-Memory-Usage.html)
demonstrated that either the approach is flawed in general, or that I'm just
bad at writing portable tests.

The module was briefly removed from the CPAN because I doubted the usefulness
of this module and didn't want to muddy the waters with a potentially
frustrating test module.

It can sometimes be tricky to determine the right level of growth, if any,
that you'll allow your process to have. Maybe my flaw was just that I set them
all to be too strict.

After receiving a tweet recently I decided to re-upload this module, and allow
people to make their own choice.

Any improvements to the module, or the test suite would be greatly
appreciated. I wrote this module to attempt to prevent horrific memory leaks
in some code I was maintaining, so this or something like this could be
beneficial.
